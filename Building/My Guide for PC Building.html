        How  to  Build  a  PC:  The  Ultimate  Beginner's  Guide</h1>  
        <h1  style="display:  inline-block;">P</h1>erhaps  you've  only  ever  used  prebuilt  desktops,  or  relied  on  a  laptop.  But  if  you  always  thought  that  building  your
          own  desktop  PC  was  beyond  you,  take  heart:  If  you  have  the  confidence  to  wield  a  screwdriver  and  follow  basic  instructions,
            you  can  do  it.  Indeed,  putting  together  a  PC  these  days  is  not  entirely  unlike  assembling  IKEA  furniture.  The  most  rewarding  part  
            is  that,  unlike  with  that  blondwood  bookcase,  you  get  to  select  the  right  parts  to  go  together  and  make  it  your  own.

        You  can  find  plenty  of  PC  building  guides  and  videos  on  the  internet.  Our  aim  with  this  one  is  to  provide  you  with
          the  context  you  need  to  select  each  component  and  put  your  purchases  together.  Specific  part  selection  we'll  leave
            to  our  library  of  deep-dive  guides,  referencing  them  as  we  go.  As  for  the  actual  PC  assembly,  you  can  watch  the  video  above
              or  follow  blow-by-blow  below  as  we  build  a  well-equipped  mainstream  gaming  PC  with  all  the  trimmings.PC  building  is  infinitely  varied,
                so  no  guide  can  cover  every  scenario.  But  we'll  cover  the  most  common  issues
          you'll  face  assembling  a  desktop  in  2023.  You  may  decide  to  go  fancier  or  more  budget-focused  with  your  build,  but  you'll  
          walk  away  with  a  great  grounding  in  what  you  need  to  know  to  do  the  job  with  confidence.

          Choosing  the  Key  Components
          Today,  PC  builders  are  spoiled  with  such  a  wealth  of  handsome,  modestly  priced  PC  cases,  mood  lighting  options,  
          and  color-coordinated  components  that  it's  easy  to  get  pulled  into  a  design  challenge  or  passion  project  when  all  
          you  wanted  to  do  was  build  a  simple  desktop.  To  be  sure,  there's  a  hot-rodder  element  here:  You  may  pay  a  slight  premium
            for  your  parts  versus  buying  a  pre-built  PC.  Major  PC  makers  enjoy  economies  of  scale  buying  parts  in  bulk  or  designing
              some  of  their  own  components  that  you  as  a  solo  builder  can't  attain.  But  most  of  the  time,  if  you  
          price  out  the  parts  for  your  own  build  against  the  cost  of  a  ready-made  system,  you  should  get  pretty  close.
          <img  src="../img/04ZMQrVmKfj8BgaDFc2z2nM-161.webp">
          In  selecting  components,  where  do  you  start?  The  interplay  of  the  parts  you  put  into  your  PC  is  crucial,  both  in  terms  of  compatibility
            (some  things  won't  fit  if  you  don't  choose  the  right  bits,  others  will  fit  but  won't  work)  and  suitability  to  task.  We'll  run  through  the  key  
            components  part  by  part,  point  you  to  plenty  of  help  for  each  piece,  then  discuss  building  concerns  based  on  our  basic  gaming  PC.  The  job  at  its  core  consists  
            of  mounting  things  in  a  box,  so  let's  start  with  a  few  words  about  the  container:  the  PC  case  or  chassis.
            The  PC  Case
            The  case  you  buy  sets  the  tone  for  your  whole  PC  build.  A  big  case  allows  plenty  of  room  for  drives,  giant  graphics  cards,  and  maximum-size  motherboards;  smaller  cases  fit  into  space-constrained  environments  or  entertainment  centers.  The  chassis  you  choose  is  intertwined  with  your  motherboard  choice  and  sometimes  your  PC's  power  supply.

            Do  you  mean  to  sit  your  PC  case  under  your  desk,  on  your  desk,  or  in  a  niche  in  a  bookcase  or  wall  unit?  Cases  come  in  lots  of  shapes  and  sizes:  traditional  tower  and  midtower  (usually  between  15  and  22  inches  tall);  flatter  "desktop"  cases  designed  to  lie  on  their  sides  (think  of  a  stereo  receiver);  highly  compact  cases  built  for  minimalist  configurations.  In  some  ways,  the  parts  discussed  below  can  dictate  the  kind  of  case  you  need.  Alternately,  your  case  can  dictate  the  parts  you  select.
            
            Every  PC  case  lists  the  motherboard  formats  it  supports.  The  three  main  layouts  are  ATX  (a  full-size,  mainstream  motherboard),  MicroATX  (a  smaller  variant  with  fewer  expansion  slots  and  other  surface-area-related  features),  and  Mini-ITX  (even  smaller,  usually  offering  just  a  single  slot  for  a  video  card).  You'll  see  a  few  outliers  like  XL-ATX  and  Extended  ATX  (EATX),  which  are  bigger  than  ATX,  but  first-time  builders  should  ignore  these.
            Most  cases  that  support  a  given  motherboard  format  will  also  allow  smaller  ones—most  ATX  cases,  for  example,  can  accept  MicroATX  and  Mini-ITX  motherboards.  That  said,  it's  smart  to  match  your  case's  size  class  with  your  motherboard  so  you're  not  wasting  space.

Materials  vary  widely.  You'll  still  find  boring  beige  steel  (though  the  default  hue  these  days  tends  to  be  black),  but  even  cheap  cases  can  have  flair  such  as  side-panel  windows  to  show  off  your  handiwork.  Indeed,  cases  with  one  or  more  tempered-glass  sides  have  become  very  popular  and  affordable.

If  you're  buying  a  PC  case  without  a  side  window  or  much  in  the  way  of  bling,  you  may  not  care,  but  it's  possible  these  days  to  purchase  PC  components  that  complement  a  case's  interior  or  exterior.  A  case  with  a  blackout-painted  interior  might  contrast  nicely  with  a  motherboard  that  has  a  white  or  red  printed  circuit  board  (PCB)  or  highlights.  It's  possible  to  visually  coordinate  a  PC  build  if  you're  interested  in  the  showcase  aspect  of  building;  in  fact,  the  sky's  the  limit  if  you  want  to  get  into  that  groove.

Our  build  uses  Corsair's  4000D  Airflow,  a  midtower  chassis  for  ATX  builds.  You'll  learn  plenty  more  about  it  as  we  build.  (For  more  about  buying  a  PC  case,  see  our  roundups  of  the  best  PC  cases  and  the  guides  to  towers  and  Mini-ITX  cases  linked  above.)

The  Motherboard
Veteran  PC  builders  will  argue  that  the  motherboard  should  be  the  first  thing  you  select  in  a  PC  build,  and  all  else  will  flow  down  from  there.  They're  not  wrong.  Essentially  your  PC's  backbone  or  foundation,  the  motherboard  is  very  much  tied  into  all  your  other  component  choices.

The  nuances  of  motherboard  shopping  are  many,  but  basically  come  down  to  three  things:  (1)  You  need  a  motherboard  that  works  with  the  CPU  you  choose;  (2)  the  board  should  be  the  right  size  and  shape  ("form  factor")  for  your  case;  and  (3)  it  should  have  the  external  ports  and  internal  expansion  slots  you  need  for  what  you  plan  to  install.

On  the  first  front,  the  key  factors  are  the  motherboard's  socket  type  and  its  chipset  (the  latter  is  its  built-in  core  operating  silicon).  These  dictate  which  processors  you  can  install  and  how  you  can  take  advantage  of  the  overall  platform.  For  new  motherboards  for  a  first-time  builder,  the  relevant  sockets  are  those  that  fit  with  the  latest  mainstream  Intel  and  AMD  CPUs:  Intel  Socket  LGA  1700  and  AMD's  AM4  and  AM5  for  Intel  Core  and  AMD  Ryzen  chips  respectively.  The  newer  AM5  houses  the  very  latest  Ryzen  parts,  but  AM4  remains  relevant  for  budget  buyers  given  the  huge  range  of  still-available  and  economical  Ryzen  CPUs  that  work  with  it.
Your  local  electronics  mart  may  also  offer  motherboards  with  other  sockets  for  high-end  desktop  (HEDT)  systems:  Intel's  Socket  LGA  2066  for  the  Core  X-Series  and  AMD's  TR4/sTRX4  for  Ryzen  Threadripper  CPUs.  There's  nothing  stopping  you  from  selecting  one  of  these,  but  these  motherboards  and  processors  are  expensive—at  the  extremes,  very  expensive—and  only  make  sense  for  certain  power  users  or  professional  content  creators.

As  noted,  the  motherboard's  chipset  dictates  the  CPUs  it  works  with,  the  level  of  supporting  features  the  board  has,  and  where  it  fits  in  the  range  of  boards  available  for  a  given  chip.
<img  src="../img/04ZMQrVmKfj8BgaDFc2z2nM-2.fit_lim.size_768x.jpg">
For  our  build,  we're  using  an  Asus  Prime  B660-Plus  D4  motherboard.  The  B  designates  it  a  second-from-the-top  platform  for  Intel  12th  and  13th  Generation  CPUs.  Top-end  Intel  boards  use  chipsets  that  start  with  Z;  high-end  AMD  boards  have  chipsets  that  start  with  X.  Both  makers  use  a  B  series  as  their  second  tier.  Check  out  the  links  below  for  much  more  on  these  distinctions;  finding  the  best  motherboard  is  among  the  most  complicated  aspects  of  PC  part  shopping.

The  CPU  and  the  CPU  Cooler
You  choose  a  CPU  in  concert  with  your  motherboard;  one  must  support  the  other.  As  with  motherboards,  the  considerations  when  choosing  a  processor  are  complex  and  tied  into  what  you  can  afford  and  what  you'll  use  your  PC  to  do,  as  well  as  aspects  like  power  consumption  and  cooling.  The  relevant  CPU  lines  today  are  Intel's  11th  through  13th  Gen  Core  and  AMD's  Ryzen  5000  and  7000  series.  

We're  skipping  over  very  low-end  CPUs  like  Intel's  Celeron  and  Pentium  and  AMD's  Athlon.  There's  nothing  intrinsically  wrong  with  these  chips,  but  if  you're  going  to  the  effort  of  building  a  PC,  you  should  save  enough  to  afford  at  least  a  modest  mainstream  Core  or  Ryzen  CPU.  If  your  budget's  too  tight,  buy  a  pre-built  consumer  system  and  take  advantage  of  the  manufacturer's  economies  of  scale.

For  our  sample  build,  we  chose  the  Intel  Core  i7-13700K,  our  current  top  pick  for  gaming  processors  and  an  excellent  choice  for  productivity  and  content  creation  as  well.  These  13th  Gen  Intel  chips  tend  to  run  hot,  and  you'll  likely  want  a  liquid  cooling  system  rather  than  just  a  heatsink  or  fan  for  this  processor.  The  K  suffix  indicates  that  the  chip  is  overclockable,  but  even  if  you  don't  overclock,  liquid  is  the  way  to  go.

Some  lesser  (non-K)  chips  in  Intel's  13th  Gen  line  come  with  a  CPU  cooler  that  will  suffice  for  them.  But  we've  selected  an  aftermarket  Corsair  H100i  Elite  all-in-one  liquid  cooler.  (For  deep  dives  into  buying  the  right  processor  and  our  current  top  picks,  see  our  guides  to  the  best  CPUs  and  best  CPUs  for  gaming,  plus  our  guide  to  finding  the  right  CPU  cooler.)

The  Memory  Kit
Depending  on  the  CPU  and  motherboard  you  buy,  you'll  need  DDR4  or  DDR5  memory.  You'll  want  to  check  your  motherboard's  peak  memory  speeds,  and  if  you're  a  performance  hound  buy  a  memory  kit  that  works  hand-in-hand  with  that  motherboard  support  near  the  top  of  the  range.  Intel  motherboards  support  a  technology  called  Extended  Memory  Profiles  (XMP),  an  auto-overclocking  and  -optimization  scheme  to  sync  your  memory  and  your  motherboard.  Look  for  XMP  settings  in  common  between  your  memory  kit  and  the  board  in  question.  AMD  recently  introduced  a  similar  scheme  that  works  with  its  Ryzen  7000  AM5  platform  dubbed  AMD  Expo.

How  much  memory  to  get  depends  on  your  usage  case  and  your  budget.  Today's  barest  of  bare  minimums  for  a  Windows  desktop  is  8GB,  with  16GB  or  32GB  easily  attainable  at  current  RAM  prices.  For  a  mainstream  build,  you'll  want  a  matching  pair  of  memory  modules  so  you  can  take  advantage  of  dual-channel  memory  speeds.  (Mixing  and  matching  different  speeds  and  brands  memory  is  not  recommended.)  For  higher-end  systems,  you  may  want  four  modules;  some  Threadripper  and  Core  X  platforms  can  support  as  many  as  eight.

If  you  have  a  side-windowed  case,  some  memory  modules  have  RGB  lighting  or  other  decorative  extras.  A  more  important  thing  to  look  for  is  compatibility  with  what's  known  as  the  QVL  (qualified  vendor  list)  for  a  given  motherboard.  Check  the  list  of  modules  tested  with  your  motherboard  by  the  latter's  manufacturer.  It  doesn't  mean  other  modules  won't  work  fine,  but  it's  an  added  bit  of  assurance  when  you're  purchasing.  Some  memory  makers  such  as  Crucial  and  Kingston  provide  advice  on  what  memory  works  with  a  given  motherboard.
<img  src="../img/04ZMQrVmKfj8BgaDFc2z2nM-4.webp">
Our  build  uses  a  Corsair  Vengeance  RGB  RS  kit  of  32GB  (two  16GB  modules),  with  a  peak  memory  speed  of  3200MHz.  (For  more  about  the  nuances  of  memory,  including  specs  related  to  memory  speeds,  latency,  and  capacity  per  module,  see  our  guide  to  how  to  pick  the  right  RAM.)

The  Storage:  SSDs  and  Hard  Drives
You  can  go  a  bunch  of  directions  with  your  PC's  storage  subsystem  these  days,  but  the  smart  default  pick  with  new  motherboards  is  a  solid-state  boot  drive  in  the  M.2  format  supporting  PCI  Express  data  transfers.  Stick-of-gum-sized  M.2  drives  save  space  inside  your  chassis,  reduce  cable  clutter,  and  provide  access  to  the  high-speed  PCI  Express  (abbreviated  PCIe)  bus.  PCI  Express  4.0  drives  have  emerged  as  the  high-end  performance  standard  these  days.

You  can  still,  of  course,  install  an  old-school  platter  hard  drive,  which  costs  much  less  per  gigabyte  than  an  SSD.  Chances  are,  however,  you  won't  need  more  than  2TB  of  storage,  so  should  stick  with  SSDs.  If  you  need  8TB  or  10TB  or  more  of  mass  storage,  opt  for  hard  drives,  since  mainstream  solid-state  drives  top  out  at  4TB  and  are  expensive  at  that  capacity.
<img  src="../img/04ZMQrVmKfj8BgaDFc2z2nM-5.fit_lim.size_768x.jpg">
Our  build  uses  a  2TB  Corsair  MP600  M.2  PCI  Express  boot  drive  for  the  Windows  operating  system  and  applications,  plus  a  3.5-inch  hard  drive  to  give  8TB  of  secondary  storage  on  the  cheap.  (For  details  on  buying  the  right  drives  and  our  current  top  picks,  see  our  guides  to  the  best  M.2  drives  and  best  internal  SSDs.)

The  Power  Supply
We'll  get  into  the  different  sizes  of  power  supply  unit  (PSU)  later  on,  but  you'll  want  to  use  an  online  web  calculator  such  as  the  invaluable  PCPartPicker  to  determine  the  minimum  PSU  wattage  you'll  need  based  on  the  other  parts  you're  installing.  The  CPU  and  graphics  card  you  choose  have  the  biggest  bearing  on  power  requirements.

We'll  also  talk  later  about  modular,  semi-modular,  and  fixed-cable  power  supplies.  All  you  need  to  know  right  now  is  that  when  shopping,  you  must  match  or  exceed  the  total  minimum  wattage  for  the  components  you're  installing,  and  the  form  factor  of  the  power  supply  needs  to  match  that  of  your  PC  case.

<img  src="../img/04ZMQrVmKfj8BgaDFc2z2nM-6.webp">

For  this  build,  we've  chosen  a  Corsair  RM750e  modular  power  supply,  which  should  provide  plenty  of  power  for  the  rest  of  our  components  and  let  us  plug  in  just  the  cables  we  need  for  neatness'  sake.  It  uses  the  ATX  form  factor,  more  about  which  later.  (For  more  on  the  topic,  see  our  guide  to  PC  power  supplies.)
The  Graphics  Card
Everyday  tasks  like  word  processing,  spreadsheeting,  and  online  browsing  are  fine  with  the  integrated  graphics  built  into  most  CPUs,  but  if  you  plan  on  gaming  or  running  demanding  content  creation  software  or  workstation  apps,  you'll  need  a  dedicated  graphics  card  with  its  own  GPU  (graphics  processing  unit).  It's  a  complex  component  to  shop  for,  but  basically  comes  down  to  whether  you  play  games,  which  monitor  you  own,  and  how  much  you  can  afford.  (If  you  do  decide  to  stick  with  your  processor's  integrated  graphics,  be  sure  your  motherboard  has  video  outputs—not  all  do!—so  you  can  connect  your  monitor.)

Be  prepared  to  make  an  investment:  Graphics-card  prices  have  skyrocketed  since  the  late  2010s,  when  crypto  mining  boosted  demand  and  the  pandemic  crimped  supplies.  It's  key  not  to  overbuy.  You  want  to  weigh  your  target  resolution  based  on  your  monitor,  the  latter's  peak  refresh  rate,  and  the  type  of  games  you  play.  (Recent  gaming  monitors  support  very  high  refresh  rates,  supporting  high-end  GPUs  that  can  deliver  gameplay  at  hundreds  of  frames  per  second.)  You'll  also  need  to  consider  the  space  available  inside  your  chassis;  recent  high-end  graphics  cards  from  Nvidia  and  AMD  are  frankly  enormous,  10  inches  or  a  foot  long  and  two  or  three  expansion  slots  wide.
AMD's  Radeon  and  Nvidia's  GeForce  are  the  two  big  GPU  brands,  and  both  offer  high-end  cards  for  gameplay  on  monitors  up  to  4K  resolution.  We  selected  a  not-quite-top-of-the-line  GeForce  RTX  4070  Ti  card.  Cards  based  on  this  GPU  start  around  $600  and  are  powerhouses  for  playing  games  at  high  detail  and  image-quality  settings  at  1440p  and  to  a  lesser  extent  4K.
<img  src="../img/04ZMQrVmKfj8BgaDFc2z2nM-7.webp">
This  particular  card  is  manufactured  by  PNY,  but  many  other  makers  offer  RTX  4070  Ti  cards  with  slightly  different  designs  and  cooling  schemes.  All  should  be  in  roughly  the  same  performance  ballpark,  however.  Decent  mainstream  GPUs  these  days  start  at  around  $300,  with  mostly  older  models  for  basic  1080p  gaming  in  the  $100  to  $200  range.  (For  more  on  the  topic  and  our  current  top  picks,  see  our  guide  to  the  best  graphics  cards.)


Some  Extra  Bits:  Six  RGB  Fans,  and  an  Internal  USB  Hub
Our  Corsair  case  has  several  preinstalled  120mm  cooling  fans  and  the  liquid  cooler  has  two  of  its  own.  But  we  decided  to  go  all  in  on  RGB  lighting  and  replace  them  all,  adding  two  three-packs  of  RGB  fans  with  each  pack  including  a  multiport  RGB  controller.  (We  only  need  to  use  one  of  the  controllers.)  The  kits  are  Corsair's  SP120  RGB  Elite.

Each  fan  has  two  cables—one  for  RGB,  one  for  power  and  control—and  the  controller  will  bundle  all  the  RGB  cables  under  one  component  roof.  Four  of  the  fans  go  on  the  chassis  (three  up  front  as  intakes,  one  in  the  back  as  an  exhaust),  while  the  other  two  will  replace  the  plain-vanilla  fans  on  the  CPU  cooler's  radiator.  The  case  fans  will  attach  to  the  motherboard,  and  the  radiator  fans  will  attach  to  a  cable  cluster  included  with  the  liquid  cooler.
<img  src="../img/04ZMQrVmKfj8BgaDFc2z2nM-10.webp">
Also  part  of  our  build  is  an  unusual  accessory:  an  internal  USB  header  hub.  Our  motherboard  has  two  built-in  USB  2.0  headers,  but  our  build  will  need  three  (for  the  RGB  controller,  the  Wi-Fi  card,  and  the  CPU  liquid  cooler).  So  this  splitter  of  sorts  (Corsair's  Internal  4-Port  USB  2.0  Hub)  costs  about  $25  and  adds  more  USB  2.0  header  connectors  to  the  case.



Performing  the  PC  Build,  Blow  by  Blow
Also  part  of  our  build  is  an  unusual  accessory:  an  internal  USB  header  hub.  Our  motherboard  has  two  built-in  USB  2.0  headers,  but  our  build  will  need  three  (for  the  RGB  controller,  the  Wi-Fi  card,  and  the  CPU  liquid  cooler).  So  this  splitter  of  sorts  (Corsair's  Internal  4-Port  USB  2.0  Hub)  costs  about  $25  and  adds  more  USB  2.0  header  connectors  to  the  case.

The  Parts  List  and  the  Pricing
So  here  we  have  a  breakout  of  all  the  components  we've  chosen,  along  with  pricing  links  to  find  them.  As  you  can  see,  our  sample  build  totaled  up  to  just  over  $2,000  street  price  at  the  time  we  published  this  story.
